## **I. Overview & Mission**

### **1\. What Is "haven"?**

"haven" is a dedicated crisis intervention sanctuary at Burning Man, designed to provide immediate, compassionate, and multi-tiered care to individuals experiencing emotional, psychological, or substance-related crises. Unlike purely medical or purely spiritual support systems, *haven* merges the practical with the profound—creating a warm, well-lit harbor for those weathering inner storms.

The name "haven" was chosen deliberately—it evokes refuge, sanctuary, protection, and safety. It also echoes the playa environment's metaphoric harshness, offering not just escape but **stabilization and reintegration**.

In practice, *haven* is staffed by trained volunteers and professionals from across the Burning Man ecosystem, including Green Dot Rangers, Zendo alumni, mental health workers, and medical liaisons. It operates autonomously, but is deeply embedded in the larger support web of Black Rock City: collaborating with Rampart, ESD, KHAKI, and CIT/SAT teams.

Whether someone is undergoing a psychedelic crisis, emotional trauma, panic attack, grief event, or destabilizing existential moment—*haven* is built to meet them **where they are**, with safety, dignity, and care.
