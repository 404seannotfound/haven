### **3\. Core Philosophies**

* **Harm Reduction**: Recognize and respond to substance-related and psychological distress without judgment. Prioritize informed care and mitigate risks without shaming or coercion.  
* **Non-Judgmental Support**: Offer all services from a stance of respect and compassion, regardless of behavior, background, or altered state.  
* **Trauma-Informed Practice**: Ensure all interactions avoid re-traumatization and encourage empowerment, autonomy, and consent.  
* **Continuity of Care**: Facilitate seamless handoffs, clear documentation, and shared knowledge between staff and shifts.  
* **Community Resilience**: Equip volunteers and passengers alike with tools, education, and presence to carry the ethos of *haven* back into the wider cityâ€”and into the world.  
* **Passenger-Centered Language**: We use "passenger" to reframe how we view individuals in crisis: they are on a journey, not defined by a diagnosis. Our job is to help them travel through the storm, not label or pathologize them.
