## **II. Organizational Structure**

### **4\. Organizational Overview**

The organizational model of *haven* is both **bottom-up and care-centric**, built to prioritize those doing direct, one-on-one emotional and crisis support work. At its foundation are the *seers*, the essential peer responders, supported by a robust and responsive command structure above them. Every layer of the hierarchy exists to **serve the needs of those holding the line in the storm**.

This model reinforces *haven*'s core philosophy: that crisis care should be collaborative, flexible, and grounded in compassionâ€”not bureaucracy. Decision-making is as decentralized as possible, while still ensuring clear lines of authority during critical incidents.

Key Elements:

* **Peer-Led Culture**: Frontline care providers (seers) are empowered with autonomy and respect.  
* **Supportive Command**: Leaders at every level are trained to respond *to the needs of the floor*, not just top-down policy.  
* **Integrated Collaboration**: Partnerships with Black Rock Rangers, ESD, CIT/SAT teams, and others are embedded into the structure.  
* **Dual Branch Model**: The organizational system is split into two interconnected domains:  
  * **Operational**: Field-based care, logistics, and on-playa response  
  * **Administrative**: Recruitment, training, supplies, records, communication, and support infrastructure

Each position within *haven* carries specific responsibilities and escalation protocols, ensuring smooth transitions, consistent care, and safe outcomes. This chapter breaks down both sides of the structure, defining each role with clarity and purpose.
