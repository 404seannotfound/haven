### **10\. Training & Orientation**

Training at *haven* is a blend of **online learning, in-person practice, and on-playa experience**. It ensures that every team member, regardless of background, enters the space informed, confident, and connected. Training is also a cultural onboarding—about learning how we care, not just what we do.
