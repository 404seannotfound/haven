## **IV. Policies & Procedures**

### **12\. Intake, Triage, and Levels of Care**

At *haven*, intake and triage are the **first points of contact** for a passenger entering care. These steps are crucial for ensuring each individual receives the right type of support, in the right place, from the right people.

Our approach is designed to be flexible, compassionate, and situationalâ€”responding to the passenger's state rather than forcing them into a rigid protocol. The following system outlines our **four Levels of Care**, guiding triage and support throughout the space.

#### **Intake Protocol**

1. **Initial Contact**  
   * Passenger arrives via walk-in, Ranger, ESD, or peer escort  
   * Greeted by Lead or SUP  
   * Brought into the **Intake Zone** for initial evaluation  
2. **Assessment**  
   * Ask: What happened? What do you need?  
   * Conduct non-invasive observation (speech, movement, coherence, orientation)  
   * Gather known medical/psychiatric history if available  
   * Check vital signs (temp, pulse, SpO2) when appropriate  
3. **Consent & Comfort**  
   * Explain role of *haven*, clarify boundaries  
   * Offer food, water, blankets, space to sit or lie down  
4. **Documentation**  
   * Create or update Passenger Record ("The captains log")  
   * Note triage level, intake time, name/callsign of staff involved

**Staff**: Seers only  
**Indicators**:

* Tired, dehydrated, disoriented  
* Needs rest, quiet, water, grounding  
* No safety concerns

**ðŸŸ¡ Level 2: Emotional Support**  
**Setting**: Mid-zone, dim space, moderate stimulation  
**Staff**: seers with Lead support  
**Indicators**:

* Mild to moderate distress, grief, or anxiety  
* Expressive but coherent  
* Requests to talk, process, be heard

**ðŸŸ  Level 3: Crisis Intervention**  
**Setting**: Private or semi-private area, low stimulation  
**Staff**: Lead \+ Seer, SUP on standby  
**Indicators**:

* Panic attacks, acute trauma, psychedelic distress  
* Heightened emotions, body tension, or confusion  
* May need containment, breathwork, grounding techniques

**ðŸ”´ Level 4: Emergency/Escalated**  
**Setting**: Secure zone, quiet, medically adjacent if needed  
**Staff**: SUP-led team \+ Safety Officer, KHAKI or ESD alerted  
**Indicators**:

* Unconscious, violent, at risk of harming self or others  
* Seizures, delusions, hallucinations  
* Needs medical evaluation, external care

---

#### **Reassessment Protocol**

* Every 20â€“30 minutes, Seers or Leads check on all passengers  
* Update level of care if signs improve or deteriorate  
* Communicate all changes in care level to SUPs and document in The Book

This tiered approach allows *haven* to triage effectively while preserving the dignity, autonomy, and humanity of each passenger. **We meet them where they areâ€”not where we think they should be.**
