### **13\. Medical Protocols**

While *haven* is not a licensed medical facility, it works in close collaboration with Black Rock City's Emergency Services Department (ESD), Rampart, and KHAKI to ensure that medical issues are promptly identified and safely handled. Our role is one of informed observation, basic assessment, and seamless handoff—not diagnosis or treatment.

---

#### **Medical Philosophy**

* Prioritize safety and preservation of life  
* Do no harm through inaction, misjudgment, or delay  
* Act within scope: observe, report, escalate  
* Respect consent and autonomy unless overridden by immediate danger

---

#### **Vital Signs Protocol**

For any passenger who appears altered, distressed, or physically compromised, Seers and Leads may request a vitals check by trained personnel (SUP, Safety Officer, or EMT-qualified staff).

**Recommended Vitals to Check:**

* **Pulse (HR)**: \>120 or \<50 \= escalate  
* **Respiratory Rate**: \>24 or \<10 \= escalate  
* **SpO₂ (oxygen saturation)**: \<94% \= immediate escalation to SUP  
* **Temperature**: \>101.5°F (38.6°C) \= alert SUP, consider heat-related illness

If readings are abnormal or cannot be obtained, escalate immediately.

#### **Medical Red Flags**

These symptoms require immediate notification of the SUP and potential handoff to ESD:

* Seizure activity (observed or reported)  
* Hallucinations involving physical aggression  
* Suicidal or homicidal ideation  
* Chest pain or difficulty breathing  
* Severe disorientation or unresponsiveness  
* Loss of consciousness  
* Signs of overdose (pinpoint pupils, blue lips, slow or stopped breathing)

---

#### **When to Call KHAKI / ESD**

SUPs and Safety Officers should alert KHAKI (Ranger HQ) or ESD when:

* A Level 4 passenger is unmanageable by internal protocols  
* Physical health crisis requires EMT or physician assessment  
* Passenger requests formal medical treatment  
* Safety of staff or others is at risk

All medical contacts must be documented immediately in The Book and on appropriate incident forms.

---

#### **Restraint Protocol**

Only SUPs and Safety Officers may initiate or supervise use of **soft restraints**, and only in extreme cases where safety is at risk and no medical personnel are immediately available.

* Always seek consent or least-restrictive approach first  
* Use team approach (at least 3 trained responders)  
* Monitor and document vitals every 5 minutes  
* Notify KHAKI and prepare for transfer to ESD

---

#### **Medical Equipment on Site**

* **AED** (automated external defibrillator)  
* **Basic first aid kit** (bandages, gloves, antiseptic, etc.)  
* **PPE** (gloves, masks, eye protection)  
* **Pulse oximeter, thermometer, BP cuff, stethoscope**  
* **Blankets, hydration supplies, cooling packs**

All medical supplies are maintained and inspected daily by the Safety Officer or designated gear tech.

At *haven*, our job is to care deeply, act wisely, and **know when to escalate**. We are the bridge—not the hospital.
