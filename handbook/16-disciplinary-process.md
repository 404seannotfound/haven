### **16\. Disciplinary Process**

While *haven* prioritizes trust, care, and support, it is essential to maintain clear and consistent accountability practices. The Disciplinary Process exists not to punish, but to protect the safety and integrity of our space, our passengers, and our team.

#### **Philosophy of Accountability**

* Compassion and directness are not mutually exclusive.  
* Conflict is a growth opportunity, not a failure.  
* Everyone, regardless of role, is accountable to the same principles.  
* Restoration is prioritized before removal when safety permits.

#### **Grounds for Disciplinary Review**

* Repeated lateness or absence from shifts  
* Breach of confidentiality  
* Boundary violations (physical, emotional, sexual)  
* Intoxication on shift or hangover affecting ability to serve  
* Disrespectful, aggressive, or undermining behavior toward staff or passengers  
* Failure to follow safety or medical protocols  
* Unauthorized use of radios, gear, or restricted areas

#### **Disciplinary Pathway**

1. **Informal Conversation**  
   * A Lead, SUP, or Overseer may initiate a quiet check-in  
   * Clarify behavior, explore context, and re-align expectations  
2. **Written Concern**  
   * Formal concern documented by SUP or Director  
   * Volunteer may be asked to rest shifts or change roles  
   * Plan for corrective action agreed upon  
3. **Escalation to Directors**  
   * For unresolved, repeated, or high-impact issues  
   * Directors meet with involved parties and review documentation  
   * Final decisions may include removal from role, shifts, or the event  
4. **Post-Event Follow-Up**  
   * For major incidents, Directors may reach out post-event to debrief  
   * Reboarding may require additional steps in future years

#### **Restorative Options**

* Peer mediation (with neutral support)  
* Apology or harm-repair conversation  
* Temporary reassignment to a lower-intensity or non-passenger role  
* Mentorship or retraining

This process is not about blameâ€”it's about alignment. When in doubt, *ask early, name clearly, and repair with heart.*
